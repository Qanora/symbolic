# symbolic

This is a symbolic execution engine for a toy stack language written as a companion to my blog post [Symbolic Execution: Intuition and Implementation](http://www.usrsb.in/symbolic-execution-intuition-and-implementation.html).

It can be built and run with [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/):

```
stack build
stack exec symbolic
```
